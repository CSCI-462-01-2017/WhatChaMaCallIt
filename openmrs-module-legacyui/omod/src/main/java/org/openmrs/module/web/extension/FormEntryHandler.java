 * same place in the UI when the user indicates they want to enter a form, and wants to pick which form.
 * 
 * If your module wants to be able to take over the view or edit links in the list of existing encounters, then your subclass
 * should override the {@link #getViewFormUrl()} and {@link #getFormsModuleCanView()} methods (for viewing) and/or
 * the {@link #getEditFormUrl()} and {@link #getFormsModuleCanEdit()} methods (for editing).
 * 
 * [WARNING: Do not be surprised if this class changes substantially in OpenMRS 1.6.]
